# Data-analyst-practise(Continuing)
Hi, Iâ€™m Tony Lan, an IT student at Monash University passionate about data and technology. I am actively building practical skills in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), MySQL, and Excel, while expanding my knowledge into areas such as machine learning and data-driven problem solving.

This repository serves as a record of my continuous self-learning journey, showcasing projects, coding exercises, and analytical tasks. My goal is to strengthen both my technical expertise and my ability to apply data insights to real-world challenges, step by step, as I grow into a data professional.
