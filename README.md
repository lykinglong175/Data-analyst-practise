# Data-analyst-practise(Continuing)
Hi, Iâ€™m Tony Lan, an IT student graaduated at Monash University passionate about data and technology. 

This repository serves as a record of my continuous self-learning journey, showcasing projects, coding exercises, and analytical tasks. My goal is to strengthen both my technical expertise and my ability to apply data insights to real-world challenges, step by step, as I grow into a data professional.

There are branches in this repo for different skills I've been working on, pls have a look if interested ;)
